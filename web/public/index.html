        <br>Wazobia Privacy Notice</br>

        <br>Effective July 8, 2020</br>

        <br>
        When Wazobia (thatâ€™s us), receives information from you, our Wazobia Privacy Policy describes how we handle
        that information.
        </br>

        <br>
        1. Account Data
        You do not have to create an account to participate in Wazobia. You will be signed in anonymously to our server,
        which means that you will get a temporary authentication token that allows your donations and validations gain
        access into our database. It is a measure to protect our server from hackers. Your authentication is valid until
        you delete a user or switch to another user. All the metadata collected in this page are non-traceable. Hence,
        it is impossible to associate you(specifically) with them. The metadata excluding the nickname is merely used to
        classify voice donations. Your nickname is stored only locally in your device to aid the multi-user feature.
        Thus, we do not save it in our servers.
        </br>

        <br>
        2. Voice Recordings
        Voice recordings, may be available in the Wazobia database for public consumption and use under a Creative
        Commons Zero License (CC0).
        </br>

        <br>
        3. Interaction and Technical Data
        We use Google Analytics to better understand how you interact with the Wazobia app. For example, we may track
        de-identified information such as the number of voice samples you record or listen to, interactions with buttons
        and menus, and session length.
        </br>
